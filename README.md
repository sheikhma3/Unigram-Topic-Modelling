# Unigram-Topic-Modelling-Using-LDA-Technique
This is implementation of topic modelling where topics will be unigram. It is basic implemented in python for understanding the concept of topic Modelling. 
This notebook will load the document file which contains the text data. We want topics that are being discussed in this topic. For this we are using LDA technique for topic modelling. This technique will cluster the documents and then identify the topics that are being discussed in that cluster. This will provide a score with topic for a cluster. 
These topics are purely unigram. There is implementation of n-grams topic model in seperate notebook.
